REGRESSIONS:


- Port ActiveSync backend to non-recursive Automake.


IMPROVEMENTS:


- Add a check for qt-mobility for QtContacts backend.


- Probably client test should be built only when unit tests or integration tests
  are enabled.


- Look at the note at the bottom of configure.ac:

  # Avoid hard-coding paths in backends. These names are chosen so
  # that a backend can alternatively use its own top-level configure
  # with PKG_CHECK_MODULES(SYNCEVOLUTION, "syncevolution") to set them.
  # need absolute path, use pwd instead of relative $srcdir
  SYNCEVOLUTION_CFLAGS=-I`cd $srcdir && pwd`/src
  SYNCEVOLUTION_LIBS=`pwd`/src/syncevo/libsyncevolution.la
  AC_SUBST(SYNCEVOLUTION_CFLAGS)
  AC_SUBST(SYNCEVOLUTION_LIBS)

  Backends does not have their own top-level configure scripts, so usage of
  absolute path have to be checked. For now this is worked around
  in generated backends.am. Also, for relative path not $(srcdir) should be used
  but $(builddir).


- Review CLEANFILES, DISTCLEANFILES, MAINTAINERCLEANFILES and MOSTLYCLEANFILES.
  That is - check which files should be assigned to which of CLEAN variables.


- Check why distcheck outputs:
  ==================
  All 0 tests passed
  ==================

  There should have been at least one test being run. The same behavior exists
  in old build system.

  This is because neither unit tests nor integration tests are enabled by
  default. If we would want to enable them then we should add
  --enable-unit-tests and --enable-integration-tests into
  DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS in toplevel Makefile.am.


- Check why there are so many failed tests when running `make check' explicitly.
  The same number of failures exists in old build system:

  Run: 583   Failure total: 528   Failures: 206   Errors: 322


- Tidy up configure.ac and some .am files.


- Maybe write scripts generating configs_xml.am, templates.am and profiles.am.


QUESTIONS:


- None.


PERSISTENT:


- Hunt for common variables clobbering.


- Silence more verbose output if found.


NITPICKS:


- Check if SyncEvolutionXML.c should always be recreated, patches always checked
  and test-client always relinked.


- Maybe do not create /share/man/man1 directory if we do not put there anything.


- If backends are static libraries then do not create /lib/syncevolution,
  because nothing is put here.


- Change $(foo) to @foo@ for all variables substituted by configure script. This
  might be useful when looking for actual value of variable appearing out of
  nowhere in .am file. Maybe make also all configure variables UPPER_CASE
  and all local Automake variables lower_case.


- Lower autoreconf's warnings level later. Namely - don't warn about some
  portability issues. The warnings about obsolete stuff should rather remain.
  For now only some glib macros are using obsolete features.


- Should stamp files be marked as intermediate or rather as secondary files?


- Check why 'copying selected object files to avoid basename conflicts...' is
  displayed between linking src/dbus/server/libsyncevodbusserver.la
  and compiling src/gdbus/src_gdbus_libgdbussyncevo_la-debug.lo. This is
  probably harmless.


TRACKING:


- Handle nobase prefixes. Link to track:
  http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=9289


- Explanation why make -jX used to fail:
  It failed because usually Automake generates dependencies of a library/program
  by looking at its _LIBADD/_LDADD variable. But this generation doesn't work
  correctly when _LIBADD/_LDADD variable has AC_SUBSTed variable - automake then
  just discards them and resulting _DEPENDENCIES variable does not contain them.
  As a workaround _DEPENDENCIES variable have to be written explicitly. Link to
  track:
  http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=9320
