This archive contains all files necessary to run SyncEvolution *as
part of the system*.

This means that the files have to be placed in the root file
system. This is necessary because some system services (D-Bus server)
would not be able to find them without further hacks otherwise.

To install the files, unpack them and then run:
  sudo cp -a usr/* /usr

*** Warning: *** this bypasses the system's package management. If
there are packages for your system, then better install those.
