syncevolution (1.1.99.5a-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * This version of syncevolution introduces an irreversible change to the
    config layout, see the --migrate option in the syncevolution man page.
    Migration happens automatically at first invocation.

  * This version is only know to work with version 2.32.2 of evolution.
    In particular, it probably won't work with the version of evolution in 
    squeeze.
