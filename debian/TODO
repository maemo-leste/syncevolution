  * add missing manpages for syncompare and syncevo-http-server
  * tighten dh-missing to stop just warn about filtes not installed:
    either fix install or list in "not_installed" with explanation
  * Investigate: python3-gobject, python3-twisted-web listed as
    dependencies of: syncevolution-http but they do not exist in
    the Debian archive
