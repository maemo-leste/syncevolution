Description: Evolution data synchronization program using SyncML
 SyncEvolution synchronizes Evolution's contact, calendar and task
 items via SyncML. The items are exchanged in the vCard 2.1 or 3.0
 format and iCalender 2.0 format via the Synthesis C++ client API
 library, which should make SyncEvolution compatible with the majority
 of SyncML servers. Full, one-way and incremental synchronization of
 items are supported.
