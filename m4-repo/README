This directory contains m4 macros which we store in our own git
repository because they are not necessarily available in a typical
Linux distro.

The m4 directory is created automatically during autogen.sh and
contains temporary copies of system macros. It is wiped out at the
beginning of our autogen.sh because these copies do not always work
when moving between distros: libtool had problems with that.
