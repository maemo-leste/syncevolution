Translation README

Syncevolution Moblin (GTK+) UI uses standard gettext translations (.po files)
and Transifex for translator web access.

What follows is a very short technical guide to translating. For more extensive
documentation, please refer to the GNOME localisation guide* or even the 
gettext manual** (the latter is unfortunately fairly programmer oriented).


Notes to translators
====================

1. Get the strings that need translating 

The easiest way to get the po-file is via 
http://translate.moblin.org/projects/syncevolution/ . If the file for your 
language does not exist yet, take the template file (.pot) and rename it to 
xx.po, where xx is the language code).

Alternatively if you have configured SyncEvolution sources, you can get
an up-to-date template (.pot) and .po files by running "make update-po" in 
/po source directory.


2. Translate

Simply fill in the empty msgstr strings in the file. Graphical translation 
tools such as gtranslator are available in most linux distributions.

Two features a translator must know are c-format strings and plural form handling. 
For help with c-format strings, see GNOME Localisation Guide*.  

If there are untranslatable strings or you do not understand the context, please
file a bug on moblin bugzilla (product "SyncEvolution", component "GTK UI") or 
ask on the mailing list.


3. Upload

Upload the .po file using the webservice: For existing translations click "Send 
a translation for this language". For new languages use "Add new translation".

Alternatively you can open a bug on moblin bugzilla and attach the po-file
there.



Notes to developers
===================

1. Testing to-be-translated strings:
The translation webservice produces the translation files but "make update-po" 
in /po source directory can still be useful for testing: it will update the
translation template and all translations with new strings. When a translation
is listed in po/LINGUAS, 'make' will build the message catalog (.gmo) and
"make install" will install it.

2. Getting strings translated:
The translation webservice watches 'moblin-transifex' branch. When you want your
new strings to be translated, rebase/merge from master. Depending on the case, 
you may want to mention about string changes on the mailing list.

3. Getting translated strings into a release
merge moblin-transifex to master once in a while to get translation updates.
