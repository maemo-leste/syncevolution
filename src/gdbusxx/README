This is a C++ wrapper for the GLib GDBus d-bus implementation.

SyncEvolution also includes a wrapper for another library named gdbus
which originated in the Bluez project. This implementation has been
included in-tree and getting and sending patches is a somewhat
automated process.

The plan is to drop the in-tree, Bluez gdbus as soon as Debian stable
and Ubuntu LTS both support a GLib >= 2.26 (the version first to
include GDBus). Until this happens we'll have to keep the in-tree one
around.

In order to make our lives easier, both implementation should have the
same interface.
