The test case files are as follows (take eds_task.ics as example):
    eds_task.ics                      (common case for all servers syncing with Evolution Data Server)
    eds_task.ics.funambol.tem         (server specific case)
During test, it will first try the server specific case(*.$server.tem), if not 
found fall back to the common case. 

To avoid redundancy, the server specific case is stored as a diff(patch) based on
server common case.

Makefile rules in src/Makefile-gen.am copy resp. create the necessary test files
there every time the client-test program is built. Here's how this is used.

To create new server specific test cases (using same example as above):
- cd src
- cp testcases/eds_task.ics testcases/eds_task.ics.funambol.tem
- run client-test, edit, repeat...
- commit modified patch files to git repo

To update server specific test cases:
- cd src
- make client-test
- edit testcases/eds_task.ics.funambol.tem
- run client-test, edit, repeat...
- commit modified patch files to git repo
